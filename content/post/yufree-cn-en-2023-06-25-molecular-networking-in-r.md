  <p>I found lots of research using molecular networking in this year&rsquo;s ASMS annual meeting. However, I didn&rsquo;t find R code or package for molecular networking. It seems most people using molecular networking are using GNPS and don&rsquo;t talk too much about the algorithm behind molecular networking. In this post, I will make a brief introduction about molecular networking and show some dirty code to perform molecular networking in R.</p>
