description: A new innovations state space modeling framework, incorporating Box-Cox
  transformations, Fourier series with time varying coefficients and ARMA error correction,
  is introduced for forecasting complex seasonal time series that cannot be handled
  using existing forecasting models. Such complex time series include time series
  with multiple seasonal periods, high frequency seasonality, non-integer seasonality
  and dual-calendar effects. Our new modelling framework provides an alternative to
  existing exponential smoothing models, and is shown to have many ...
