description: In the intro section of my MOB package (https://github.com/statcompute/MonotonicBinning#introduction),
  reasons and benefits of using WoE transformations in the context of logistic regressions
  with binary outcomes had been discussed. What’s more, the similar idea can be easily
  generalized to other statistical models in the credit risk area, such as LGD (Loss
  Given Default) models with fractional ...
