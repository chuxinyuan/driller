  <p>We&rsquo;re ecstatic to announce the release of usethis v2.0.0 (
  <a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usethis.r-lib.org</a>). usethis is a package that facilitates interactive workflows for R project creation and development. It&rsquo;s mostly focussed on easing day-to-day package development, but many of its functions are also useful for non-package projects.</p>
  <p>You can install usethis from CRAN with:</p>
  <div class="highlight">
  <pre class='chroma'><code class='language-r' data-lang='r'><span class='nf'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html' ...
