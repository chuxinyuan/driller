description: Cyclic temporal granularities are temporal deconstructions of a time
  period into units such as hour-of-the-day and work-day/weekend. They can be useful
  for measuring repetitive patterns in large univariate time series data, and feed
  new approaches to exploring time series data. One use is to take pairs of granularities,
  and make plots of response values across the categories induced by the temporal
  deconstruction. However, when there are many granularities that can be constructed
  for a time period, there will also be too many possible displays to decide which
  might be the more interesting to ...
