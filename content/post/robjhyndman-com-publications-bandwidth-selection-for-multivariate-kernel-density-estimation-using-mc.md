description: Kernel density estimation for multivariate data is an important technique
  that has a wide range of applications. However, it has received significantly less
  attention than its univariate counterpart. The lower level of interest in multivariate
  kernel density estimation is mainly due to the increased difficulty in deriving
  an optimal data-driven bandwidth as the dimension of the data increases. We provide
  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for estimating optimal bandwidth matrices
  for multivariate kernel density ...
