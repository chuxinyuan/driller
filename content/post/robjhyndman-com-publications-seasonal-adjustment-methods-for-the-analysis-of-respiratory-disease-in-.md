description: We study the relationship between daily hospital admissions for respiratory
  disease and various pollutant and climatic variables, looking particularly at the
  effect of seasonal adjustment on the estimated models. Often time series exhibit
  seasonal behaviour and adequate control for the presence of a seasonal component
  is essential before one attempts to model the complex pollution-health association.
  We show that if these factors are not adequately controlled for, spurious effects
  of pollutants and climate on morbidity/mortality can be ...
