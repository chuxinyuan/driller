  <p>Due to mass defect, the high resolution mass spectrum could be used for qualitative analysis. However, I am curious about the distribution of the decimal part of real compounds' exact mass. If compounds are generated randomly, the decimal part of exact mass should be uniform distributed between 0 and 1. However, we all know compounds should follow chemical property to form new compounds. In this case, let&rsquo;s see what happened for certain compounds database.</p>
  <p>Again, we use HMDB to make a demo. This is the decimal part of real compounds' exact mass for 13251 unique exact mass in ...
