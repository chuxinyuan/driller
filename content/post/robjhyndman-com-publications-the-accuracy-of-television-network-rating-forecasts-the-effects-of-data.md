description: This paper investigates the effect of aggregation in relation to the
  accuracy of television network rating forecasts. We compare the forecast accuracy
  of network ratings using population rating models, rating models for demographic/behavioural
  segments and individual viewing behaviour models. Models are fitted using neural
  networks, decision trees and regression. The most accurate forecasts are obtained
  by aggregating forecasts from segment rating models, with neural networks being
  used to fit these ...
