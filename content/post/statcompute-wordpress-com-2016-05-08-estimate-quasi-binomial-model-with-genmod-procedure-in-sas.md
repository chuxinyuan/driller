description: In my previous post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2015/11/01/quasi-binomial-model-in-sas/),
  I&#8217;ve shown why there is an interest in estimating Quasi-Binomial models for
  financial practitioners and how to estimate with GLIMMIX procedure in SAS. In the
  demonstration below, I will show an example how to estimate a Quasi-Binomial model
  with GENMOD procedure by specifying VARIANCE and DEVIANCE. While the CPU time ...
