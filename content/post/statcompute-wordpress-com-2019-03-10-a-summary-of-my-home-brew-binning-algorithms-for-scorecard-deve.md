description: Thus far, I have published four different monotonic binning algorithms
  for the scorecard development and think that it might be a right timing to do a
  quick summary. R functions for these binning algorithms are also available on https://github.com/statcompute/MonotonicBinning.
  The first one was posted back in 2017 (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2017/01/22/monotonic-binning-with-smbinning-package)
  based on my SAS macro (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/a-sas-macro-implementing-monotonic-woe-transformation-in-scorecard-development)
