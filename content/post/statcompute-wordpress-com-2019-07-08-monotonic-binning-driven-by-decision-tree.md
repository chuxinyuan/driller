description: After the development of MOB package (https://github.com/statcompute/MonotonicBinning),
  I was asked by a couple users about the possibility of using the decision tree to
  drive the monotonic binning. Although I am not aware of any R package implementing
  the decision tree with the monotonic constraint, I did manage to find a solution
  based upon the decision ...
