description: The influence of synoptic-scale circulations on air quality is an area
  of increasing interest to air quality management in regards to future climate change.
  This study presents an analysis where the dominant synoptic &lsquo;types&rsquo;
  over the region of Melbourne, Australia are determined and linked to regional air
  quality. First, a self-organising map (SOM) is used to generate a time series of
  synoptic charts that classify the annual daily circulation affecting Melbourne into
  20 different synoptic ...
