description: We discuss the admissible parameter space for some state space models,
  including the models that underly exponential smoothing methods. We find that the
  usual parameter restrictions (requiring all smoothing parameters to lie between
  0 and 1) do not always lead to stable models. We also find that all seasonal exponential
  smoothing methods are unstable as the underlying state space models are neither
  reachable nor observable. This instability does not affect the forecasts, but does
  corrupt the state ...
