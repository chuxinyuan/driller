description: In the post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2019/07/14/yet-another-r-package-for-general-regression-neural-network),
  several advantages of General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) have been discussed.
  However, as pointed out by Specht, a major weakness of GRNN is the high computational
  cost required for a GRNN to generate predicted values based on a new input matrix
  due to its unique network structure, e.g. the number of ...
