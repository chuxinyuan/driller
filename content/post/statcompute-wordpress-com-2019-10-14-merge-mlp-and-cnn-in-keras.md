description: In the post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2017/01/08/an-example-of-merge-layer-in-keras),
  it was shown how to build a merge-layer DNN by using the Keras Sequential model.
  In the example below, I tried to scratch a merge-layer DNN with the Keras functional
  API in both R and Python. In particular, the merge-layer DNN is the average of a
  multilayer perceptron network and a ...
