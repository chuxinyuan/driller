description: A new approach is proposed for forecasting a time series with multiple
  seasonal patterns. A state space model is developed for the series using the innovation
  approach which enables us to develop explicit models for both additive and multiplicative
  seasonality. Parameter estimates may be obtained using methods from exponential
  smoothing. The proposed model is used to examine hourly and daily patterns in hourly
  data for both utility loads and traffic ...
