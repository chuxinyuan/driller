description: In the previous post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2019/02/03/sobol-sequence-vs-uniform-random-in-hyper-parameter-optimization),
  it is shown how to identify the optimal hyper-parameter in a General Regression
  Neural Network by using the Sobol sequence and the uniform random generator respectively
  through the N-fold cross validation. While the Sobol sequence yields a slightly
  better performance, outcomes from both approaches are very similar, as shown below
