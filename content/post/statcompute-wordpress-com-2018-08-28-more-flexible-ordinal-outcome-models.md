description: In the previous post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2018/08/26/adjacent-categories-and-continuation-ratio-logit-models-for-ordinal-outcomes),
  we’ve shown alternative models for ordinal outcomes in addition to commonly used
  Cumulative Logit models under the proportional odds assumption, which are also known
  as Proportional Odds model. A potential drawback of Proportional Odds model is the
  lack of flexibility and the restricted assumption of proportional odds, of which
  the ...
