  target="_blank" rel="noopener">dbplyr</a> 1.3.0 is now available on CRAN. dbplyr
  is the database backend for dplyr, translating dplyr syntax into SQL. This is a
  minor release primarily for compatibility with dplyr 0.8.0. However, there have
  been some changes to the API, and minor improvements (the full details of which
  can be found in the <a href="https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/news/index.html" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">changelog</a>). A more substantive update can be expected after rstudio::conf.</p>
