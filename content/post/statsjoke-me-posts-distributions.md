  Properties of Distributions univariate/bivariate/multivariate distribution probability distributions probability density function \(p(z)\) \[P(z_{1}\leq z \leq z_{2})=\int_{z_{1}}^{z_{2}}p(x)dz\] What is moment about the origin? Moments. The moments of a distribution are a set of parameters that summarize it. Given a random variable \(X\), its first moment about the origin, denoted , is defined to be \(E[X]\). Its second moment about the origin is the population variance.
  eg.
  # normal distribution integrate(dnorm, ...
