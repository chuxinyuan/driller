  Let’s simulate p-values as a funtion of sample size. We assume that some researcher collects one data point, computes the p-value, and repeats until p-value falls below some arbitrary threshold. Oh and yes, there is no real effect. For the sake of spending the budget, assume that our researcher collects a sample size of \(n=100\).
  This idea stems from this great article False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant; ...
