description: Existing methods for time series clustering rely on the actual data values
  can become impractical since the methods do not easily handle dataset with high
  dimensionality, missing value, or different lengths. In this paper, a dimension
  reduction method is proposed that replaces the raw data with some global measures
  of time series characteristics. These measures are then clustered using a self-organizing
  map. The proposed approach has been tested using benchmark time series previously
  reported for time series clustering, and is shown to yield useful and robust ...
