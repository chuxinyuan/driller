description: Accurate estimates of future age-specific incidence and mortality are
  critical for allocation of resources to breast cancer control programs and evaluation
  of screening programs. The purpose of this study is to apply functional data analysis
  techniques to model age-specific breast cancer mortality time trends, and forecast
  entire age-specific mortality functions using a state-space approach. We use annual
  unadjusted breast cancer mortality rates in Australia, from 1921 to 2001 in five
  year age groups (45 to ...
