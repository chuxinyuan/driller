description: We consider modelling time series using a generalized additive model
  with first-order Markov structure and mixed transition density having a discrete
  component at zero and a continuous component with positive sample space. Such models
  have application, for example, in modelling daily occurrence and intensity of rainfall,
  and in modelling the number and size of insurance claims. We show how these methods
  extend the usual sinusoidal seasonal assumption in standard chain-dependent models
  by assuming a general smooth pattern of occurrence and intensity over ...
