  <p>I&rsquo;m very excited to announce that <a href="https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dtplyr</a> 1.0.0 is now on CRAN. dtplyr provides a <a href="http://r-datatable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data.table</a> backend for dplyr, allowing you to write dplyr code that is automatically translated to the equivalent data.table code.</p>
  <p>dtplyr 1.0.0 gives you the speed of data.table with the syntax of dplyr, unlocking the value of data.table to every user of dplyr. Of course, if you know data.table, you can still write it directly, just as we expect SQL experts ...
