  Introduction Asthma can be exacerbated by exposure to various fungal spores and Human Rhinovirus [HRV], but current understanding of the importance of fungal exposure to child asthma hospitalisations is limited. Moreover the interaction between HRV and fungal spore exposure on admission has not been examined.
  Aim To investigate the role of outdoor fungal spores in child asthma hospitalisations and if HRV modifies any such effect.
