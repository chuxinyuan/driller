description: |-
  In many applications, there are multiple time series that are hierarchically organized and can be aggregated at several different levels in groups based on products, geography or some other features. We call these &ldquo;hierarchical time series''. They are commonly forecast using either a &ldquo;bottom-up'' or a &ldquo;top-down'' method.
  In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up ...
