  Covariance, Regression, and Correlation Covariance Consider a set of paired variables, \((x,y)\). The Covariance of \(x\) and \(y\) is: \[\sigma(x,y)=E[(x-\mu_x)(y-\mu_y)]=E(xy)-\mu_x\mu_y\] Regression \[y=\alpha+\beta x+e\] \[\hat y=\alpha+\beta x\] \[a=\bar y-b\bar x\]
  \[b=\frac{Cov(x,y)}{Var(x)}\] The least-squares estimators for the intercept and slope of a linear regression are simple functions of the observed means, variances, and covariances. This property is exceedingly useful for quantitative genetics, since such statistics are readily obtainable from phenotypic ...
