description: 'This paper conducts an extensive forecasting study on 13,118 time series
  measuring Swiss goods exports, grouped hierarchically by export destination and
  product category. We apply existing state of the art methods in forecast reconciliation
  and introduce a novel Bayesian reconciliation framework. This approach allows for
  explicit estimation of reconciliation biases, leading to several innovations: Prior
  judgment can be used to assign weights to specific forecasts and the occurrence
  of negative reconciled forecasts can be ruled ...'
