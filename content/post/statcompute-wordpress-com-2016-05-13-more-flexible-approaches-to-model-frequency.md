  In the context of operational loss forecast models, the standard Poisson regression
  is the most popular way to model frequency measures. Conceptually speaking, there
  is a restrictive assumption for the standard Poisson regression, namely Equi-Dispersion,
  which requires the equality between the conditional mean and ...
