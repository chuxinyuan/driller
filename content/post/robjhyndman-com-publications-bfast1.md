description: A wealth of remotely sensed time series covering large areas is now available
  to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of
  detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal
  climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of
  time series enables the detection of different types of changes. Changes occurring
  in the trend component indicate disturbances (e.g., insect attack), while changes
  occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes ...
