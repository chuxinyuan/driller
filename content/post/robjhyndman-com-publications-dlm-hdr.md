description: This paper proposes a new method of interval estimation for the long
  run response (or elasticity) parameter from a general linear dynamic model. We employ
  the bias-corrected bootstrap, in which small sample biases associated with the parameter
  estimators are adjusted in two stages of the bootstrap. As a means of bias-correction,
  we use alternative analytic and bootstrap methods. To take atypical properties of
  the long run elasticity estimator into account, the highest density region (HDR)
  method is adopted for the construction of confidence ...
