description: Quantifying the observed relationships between local meteorology and
  air pollution provides air quality managers with a knowledge base that may prove
  useful in understanding how climate change may potentially impact air quality. This
  paper presents the estimated response of ozone (O3), particulate matter ≤ 10 μm
  (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to individual local meteorological variables
  in Melbourne, Australia over the period of 1999 to 2006. The relationships have
  been quantified after controlling for long-term trends, seasonality, weekly emissions,
  spatial variation, and temporal ...
