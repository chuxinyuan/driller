description: Water-quality monitoring in rivers often focuses on the concentrations
  of sediments and nutrients, constituents that can smother biota and cause eutrophication.
  However, the physical and economic constraints of manual sampling prohibit data
  collection at the frequency required to adequately capture the variation in concentrations
  through time. Here, we developed models to predict total suspended solids (TSS)
  and oxidized nitrogen (NOx) concentrations based on high-frequency time series of
  turbidity, conductivity and river level data from in situ sensors in rivers flowing
  into the Great ...
