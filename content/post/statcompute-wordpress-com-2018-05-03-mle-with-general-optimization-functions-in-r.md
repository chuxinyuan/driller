description: In my previous post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2018/02/25/mle-in-r/),
  it is shown how to estimate the MLE based on the log likelihood function with the
  general-purpose optimization algorithm, e.g. optim(), and that the optimizer is
  more flexible and efficient than wrappers in statistical packages. A benchmark comparison
  are given below showing the use case of other general optimizers commonly ...
