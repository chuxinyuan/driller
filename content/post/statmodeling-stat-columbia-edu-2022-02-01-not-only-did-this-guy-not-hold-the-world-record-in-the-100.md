title: Not only did this guy not hold the world record in the 100 meter or 110-yard
  dash for 35 years, he didnâ€™t even run the 110-yard dash in 10.8 seconds, nor did
  he see a million patients, nor was he on the Michigan football and track teams,
  nor did Michigan even have a track team when he attended the university.  It seems
  likely that he did know Jack Dempsey, though.
