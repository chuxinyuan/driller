description: Statistical process control (SPC) has evolved beyond its classical applications
  in manufacturing to monitoring economic and social phenomena. This extension requires
  consideration of autocorrelated and possibly non-stationary time series. Less attention
  has been paid to the possibility that the variance of the process may also change
  over time. In this paper we use the innovations state space modeling framework to
  develop conditionally heteroscedastic models. We provide examples to show that the
  incorrect use of homoscedastic models may lead to erroneous decisions about the
