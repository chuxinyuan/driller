description: We present an approach to improve forecast accuracy by simultaneously
  forecasting a group of products that exhibit similar seasonal demand patterns. Better
  seasonality estimates can be made by using information on all products in a group,
  and using these improved estimates when forecasting at the individual product level.
  This approach is called the group seasonal indices (GSI) approach, and is a generalization
  of the classical Holt-Winters procedure. This article describes an underlying state
  space model for this method and presents simulation results that show when it yields
  more accurate ...
