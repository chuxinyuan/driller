description: Estimating the rank of the coefficient matrix is a major challenge in
  multivariate regression, including vector autoregression (VAR). In this paper, we
  develop a novel fully Bayesian approach that allows for rank estimation. The key
  to our approach is reparameterizing the coefficient matrix using its singular value
  decomposition and conducting Bayesian inference on the decomposed parameters. By
  implementing a stochastic search variable selection on the singular values of the
  coefficient matrix, the ultimate selected rank can be identified as the number of
  nonzero singular ...
