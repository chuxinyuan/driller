description: 'In this paper we explore the hierarchical nature of tourism demand time
  series and produce short-term forecasts for Australian domestic tourism. The data
  and forecasts are organized in a hierarchy based on disaggregating the data for
  different geographical regions and for different purposes of travel. We consider
  five approaches to hierarchical forecasting: two variations of the top-down approach,
  the bottom-up method, a newly proposed top-down approach where top-level forecasts
  are disaggregated according to forecasted proportions of lower level series, and
  a recently proposed optimal ...'
