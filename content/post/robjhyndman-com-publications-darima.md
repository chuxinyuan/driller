description: Providing forecasts for ultra-long time series plays a vital role in
  various activities, such as investment decisions, industrial production arrangements,
  and farm management. This paper develops a novel distributed forecasting framework
  to tackle challenges associated with forecasting ultra-long time series by using
  the industry-standard MapReduce framework. The proposed model combination approach
  facilitates distributed time series forecasting by combining the local estimators
  of time series models delivered from worker nodes and minimizing a global loss ...
