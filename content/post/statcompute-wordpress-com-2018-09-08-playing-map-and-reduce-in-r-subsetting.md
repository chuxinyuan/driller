  I&#8217;ve shown how to employ the MapReduce when calculating by-group statistics.
  Actually, the same Divide-n-Conquer strategy can be applicable to other use cases,
  one of which is the subsetting operation. In the example below, let&#8217;s still
  use the same iris data for the demonstration purpose. In R, the most convenient
