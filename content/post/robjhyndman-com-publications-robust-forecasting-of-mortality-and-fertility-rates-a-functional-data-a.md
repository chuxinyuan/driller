description: We propose a new method for forecasting age-specific mortality and fertility
  rates observed over time. We combine ideas from functional data analysis, nonparametric
  smoothing and robust statistics to form a methodology that is widely applicable
  to any functional time series data, and age-specific mortality and fertility in
  particular. Our approach provides a modelling framework that is easily adapted to
  allow for constraints and other information. The model used can be considered a
  generalization of the Lee-Carter model commonly used in mortality and fertility
