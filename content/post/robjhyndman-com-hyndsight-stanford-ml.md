description: Andrew Ng&rsquo;s machine learning course at Stanford is being offered
  free to anyone online in the (northern) fall of 2011. I&rsquo;ve seen some of the
  notes from this course and it looks to be an excellent broad introduction to machine
  learning and data mining. For example, support vector machines, neural networks,
  kernels, clustering, dimension reduction, etc.Statisticians should know something
  about this area (just as computer scientists working in machine learning should
