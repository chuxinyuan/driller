description: In practice, GRNN is very similar to GAM (Generalized Additive Models)
  in the sense that they both shared the flexibility of approximating non-linear functions.
  In the example below, both GRNN and GAM were applied to the Kyphosis data that has
  been widely experimented in examples of GAM and revealed very similar patterns of
  functional relationships ...
