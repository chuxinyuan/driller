description: We propose a new generic method ROPES (Regularized Optimization for Prediction
  and Estimation with Sparse data) for decomposing, smoothing and forecasting two-dimensional
  sparse data. In some ways, ROPES is similar to Ridge Regression, the LASSO, Principal
  Component Analysis (PCA) and Maximum-Margin Matrix Factorisation (MMMF). Using this
  new approach, we propose a practical method of forecasting mortality rates, as well
  as a new method for interpolating and extrapolating sparse longitudinal data. We
  also show how to calculate prediction intervals for the resulting ...
