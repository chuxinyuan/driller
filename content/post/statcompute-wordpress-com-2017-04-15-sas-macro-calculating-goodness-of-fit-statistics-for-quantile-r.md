description: As shown by Fu and Wu in their presentation (https://www.casact.org/education/rpm/2010/handouts/CL1-Fu.pdf),
  the quantile regression is an appealing approach to model severity measures with
  high volatilities due to its statistical characteristics, including the robustness
  to extreme values and no distributional assumptions. Curti and Migueis also pointed
  out in a research paper (https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016002r1pap.pdf)
  that the operational loss is ...
