description: Modeling the frequency is one of the most important aspects in operational
  risk models. In the previous post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2016/05/13/more-flexible-approaches-to-model-frequency),
  the importance of flexible modeling approaches for both under-dispersion and over-dispersion
  has been discussed. In addition to the quasi-poisson regression, three flexible
  frequency modeling techniques, including generalized poisson, double poisson, and
  Conway-Maxwell poisson, with their implementations ...
