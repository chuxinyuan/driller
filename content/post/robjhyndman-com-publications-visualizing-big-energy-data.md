description: Visualization is a crucial component of data analysis. It is always a
  good idea to plot the data before fitting any models, making any predictions, or
  drawing any conclusions. As sensors of the electric grid are collecting large volumes
  of data from various sources, power industry professionals are facing the challenge
  of visualizing such data in a timely fashion. In this article, we demonstrate several
  data visualization solutions for big energy data through three case studies involving
  smart meter data, phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, and probabilistic forecasts,
