  <p>We have just updated the <a href="https://callr.r-lib.org/">callr</a> package to version 3.3.0 on CRAN.
  The biggest change in this release is better support for debugging the
  background process. See the full
  <a href="https://callr.r-lib.org/news/index.html">changelog here</a>.</p>
  <p>callr helps with running R code in a separate R process, synchronously or
  asynchronously. With synchronous execution the main R process waits until
  the separate R subprocess finishes, see <a href="https://callr.r-lib.or ...
