  <p>Today, I wanted to talk a little bit about the renewed <code>rowwise()</code> function that makes it easy to perform operations &ldquo;row-by-row&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll show how you can use <code>rowwise()</code> to compute summaries &ldquo;by row&rdquo;, talk about how <code>rowwise()</code> is a natural pairing with list-columns, and show a couple of use cases that I think are particularly elegant. You can learn more about all of these topics in <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/rowwise.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>vignette(&quot;rowwise&quot;)</code></a>.</p>
