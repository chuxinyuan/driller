description: Electricity demand forecasting plays an important role in long-term planning
  for future generation facilities and transmission augmentation. It is a challenging
  problem because of the different uncertainties including underlying population growth,
  changing technology, economic conditions, prevailing weather conditions (and the
  timing of those conditions), as well as the general randomness inherent in individual
  usage. It is also subject to some known calendar effects due to the time of day,
  day of week, time of year, and public ...
