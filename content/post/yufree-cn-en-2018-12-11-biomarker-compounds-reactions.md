  <p>When we talk about biomarker in metabolomics, most of people refer to certain compound. When this &lsquo;magic&rsquo; compound show different concentrations between control and treatment group, we could find some evidence of diseases or disorders. In a regular workflow, chemist detect compounds from mass spectrumetry peaks and biologist found the the connections between compounds. That is:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>peaks -&gt; compounds -&gt; connections among compounds</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Analytical chemist spent too much energy to make annotations for peaks, pack them into a compound list and ...
