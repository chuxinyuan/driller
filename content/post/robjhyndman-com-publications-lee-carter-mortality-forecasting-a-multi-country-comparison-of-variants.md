description: We compare the short- to medium- term accuracy of five variants or extensions
  of the Lee-Carter method for mortality forecasting. These include the original Lee-Carter,
  the Lee-Miller and Booth-Maindonald-Smith variants, and the more flexible Hyndman-Ullah
  and De Jong-Tickle extensions. These methods are compared by applying them to sex-specific
  populations of 10 developed countries using data for 1986-2000 for evaluation. All
  variants and extensions are more accurate than the original Lee-Carter method for
  forecasting log death rates, by up to ...
