description: 'Where: International Symposium on Forecasting, Nice, France Abstract:
  The most common forecasting methods in business are based on exponential smoothing
  and the most common time series in business are inherently non-negative. Therefore
  it is of interest to consider the properties of the potential stochastic models
  underlying exponential smoothing when applied to non-negative data. We explore nonlinear
  exponential smoothing state space models for non-negative data under various assumptions
  about the innovations, or error, ...'
