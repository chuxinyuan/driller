description: In the previous post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2017/06/29/model-operational-loss-directly-with-tweedie-glm),
  it has been explained why we should consider modeling operational losses for non-material
  UoMs directly with Tweedie models. However, for material UoMs with significant losses,
  it is still beneficial to model the frequency and the severity separately. In the
  prevailing modeling practice for operational losses, it is often convenient to ...
