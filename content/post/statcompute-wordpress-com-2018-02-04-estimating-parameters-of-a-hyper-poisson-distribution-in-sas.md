description: Similar to COM-Poisson, Double-Poisson, and Generalized Poisson distributions
  discussed in my previous post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2016/11/27/more-about-flexible-frequency-models/),
  the Hyper-Poisson distribution is another extension of the standard Poisson and
  is able to accommodate both under-dispersion and over-dispersion that are common
  in real-world problems. Given the complexity of parameterization and computation,
  the Hyper-Poisson is somewhat under-investigated. To the best of ...
