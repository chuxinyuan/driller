  We are often interested in the question whether two variables are &ldquo;associated&rdquo;, &ldquo;correlated&rdquo; (I mean the normal English term) or &ldquo;dependent&rdquo;. What exactly, or rather in normal words, does that mean? Let&rsquo;s look at some easy case.
  NOTE: The example has been updated to reflect a more tangible and sensible scenario (find the old one in the previous commit at Github).
  Titanic data For example, let&rsquo;s look at survival rates of the Titanic disaster, to see whether the probability of survival (event A) depends on the whether you embarked for 1st class ...
