description: with Vincent Grari, Sylvain Lamprier and Marcin Detyniecki we recently
  uploaded a paper a fair pricing model via adversarial learning on ArXiv At the core
  of insurance business lies classification between risky and non-risky insureds,
  actuarial fairness meaning that risky insureds should contribute more and pay a
  higher premium than non-risky or less-risky ones. Actuaries, therefore, use econometric
