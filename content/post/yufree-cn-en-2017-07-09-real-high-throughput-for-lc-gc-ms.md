   <p>If someone want to know whether some compounds exist in certain samples. He always need to make pretreatment for that samples and make them into a little vial for analysis in sophisticated instruments like mass spectrum. If you want to analysis many components in one sample, you also need some separation methods like gas/liquid chromatography. How about analysis multiple samples and multiple compounds in a single run?</p>
