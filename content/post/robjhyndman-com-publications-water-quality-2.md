description: River water-quality monitoring is increasingly conducted using automated
  in situ sensors, enabling timelier identification of unexpected values. However,
  anomalies caused by technical issues confound these data, while the volume and velocity
  of data prevent manual detection. We present a framework for automated anomaly detection
  in high-frequency water-quality data from in situ sensors, using turbidity, conductivity
  and river level data. After identifying end-user needs and defining anomalies, we
  ranked their importance and selected suitable detection ...
