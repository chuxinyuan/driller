description: This paper presents a meta-algorithm for approximating the Pareto optimal
  set of costly black-box multiobjective optimization problems given a limited number
  of objective function evaluations. The key idea is to switch among different algorithms
  during the optimization search based on the predicted performance of each algorithm
  at the time. Algorithm performance is modeled using a machine learning technique
  based on the available information. The predicted best algorithm is then selected
  to run for a limited number of ...
