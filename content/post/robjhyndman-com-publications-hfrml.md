description: Over the last 15 years, studies on hierarchical forecasting have moved
  away from single-level approaches towards proposing linear combination approaches
  across multiple levels of the hierarchy. Such combinations offer coherent reconciled
  forecasts, improved forecasting performance and aligned decision-making. This paper
  proposes a novel hierarchical forecasting approach based on machine learning. The
  proposed method allows for non-linear combinations of the base forecasts, thus being
  more general than linear approaches. We structurally combine the objectives of improved
  post-sample empirical ...
