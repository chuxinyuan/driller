description: The International Journal of Forecasting is calling for papers on probabilistic
  energy forecasting. Here are the details (taken from Tao Hong&rsquo;s blog). In
  today&rsquo;s competitive and dynamic environment, more and more decision making
  processes in the energy industry are relying on probabilistic forecasts. The applications
  of probabilistic energy forecasts spread across planning and operations of the entire
