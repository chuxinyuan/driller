description: Data visualization has become an integral part of statistical modelling.
  Exploratory graphical analysis allows insight into the underlying structure of observations
  in a data set, and graphical methods for diagnostic purposes after model fitting
  provide insight into the fitted model and its inadequacies. In this paper we present
  visualization methods for preliminary exploration of time series data and graphical
  diagnostic methods for modelling relationships between time series data in medicine.
  We will use exploratory graphical methods to better understand the relationship
  between a time ...
