description: This paper considers residuals for time series regression. Despite much
  literature on visual diagnostics for uncorrelated data, there is little on the autocorrelated
  case. In order to examine various aspects of the fitted time series regression model,
  three residuals are considered. The fitted regression model can be checked using
  orthogonal residuals; the time series error model can be analysed using marginal
  residuals; and the white noise error component can be tested using conditional ...
