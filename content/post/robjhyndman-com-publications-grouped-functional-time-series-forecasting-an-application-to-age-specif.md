description: Age-specific mortality rates are often disaggregated by different attributes,
  such as sex, state and ethnicity. Forecasting age-specific mortality rates at the
  national and sub-national levels plays an important role in developing social policy.
  However, independent forecasts of age-specific mortality rates at the sub-national
  levels may not add up to the forecasts at the national level. To address this issue,
  we consider the problem of reconciling age-specific mortality rate forecasts from
  the viewpoint of grouped univariate time series forecasting methods (Hyndman et
  al, 2011), and extend ...
