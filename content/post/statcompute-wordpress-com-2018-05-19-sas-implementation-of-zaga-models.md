description: In the previous post https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2017/09/17/model-non-negative-numeric-outcomes-with-zeros/,
  I gave a brief introduction about the ZAGA (Zero-Adjusted Gamma) model that provides
  us a very flexible approach to model non-negative numeric responses. Today, I will
  show how to implement the ZAGA model with SAS, which can be conducted either jointly
  or by two steps. In SAS, the FMM procedure ...
