  Basic definitions Gene Locus Alleles Sex Chromosomes Autosomes Quantitative-trait Loci (QTLs) Allele and genotype frequencies Suppose \(P_{11}\), \(P_{12}\), and \(P_{22}\) represent the proportions of the population that are \(B_1B_1\), \(B_1B_2\), and \(B_2B_2\). The frequency of the \(B_1\) allele is
