  <p>Simulating a binary dataset, coupled with an understanding of the logit link and the linear formula, is truly fascinating! However, we must exercise caution regarding our adjustments, as they can potentially divert us from the true findings. I advocate for transparency in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and emphasize the sequence: ...</p></div>
