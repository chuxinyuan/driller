  This paper demonstrates how machine learning is used to measure energy savings from energy conservation measures (ECMs); in particular ECMs with a low expected saving.
  We develop a model that predict energy consumption in buildings on an hourly level. The model is trained on energy data from the main meter before the ECMs took place. The model is then used to predict energy consumption after the ECMs.
  The difference between the prediction (the estimated energy consumption in the building given no ECMs) and the actual usage is the estimated ...
