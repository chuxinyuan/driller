description: We propose forecasting functional time series using weighted functional
  principal component regression and weighted functional partial least squares regression.
  These approaches allow for smooth functions, assign higher weights to more recent
  data, and provide a modeling scheme that is easily adapted to allow for constraints
  and other information. We illustrate our approaches using age-specific French female
  mortality rates from 1816 to 2006 and age-specific Australian fertility rates from
  1921 to 2006, and show that these weighted methods improve forecast accuracy in
  comparison to their ...
