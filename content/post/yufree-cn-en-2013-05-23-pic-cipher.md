  <p>After I finished the computational photography on the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">coursera</a>, I finally know some basic principles about the digital pictures. The peer-viewed assignment which focused on the epsilon photography is very interesting. In fact, I know nothing about this term before but when I take some photos, I found it awesome to perform something interesting.
