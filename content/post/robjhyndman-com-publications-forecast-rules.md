description: For univariate forecasting, there are various statistical models and
  computational algorithms available. In real-world exercises, too many choices can
  create difficulties in selecting the most appropriate technique, especially for
  users lacking sufficient knowledge of forecasting. This study focuses on rule induction
  for forecasting method selection by understanding the nature of historical forecasting
  data. A novel approach for selecting a forecasting method for univariate time series
  based on measurable data characteristics is presented that combines elements of
  data mining, meta-learning, ...
