description: With the growing importance of time series clustering research, particularly
  for similarity searches amongst long time series such as those arising in medicine
  or finance, it is critical for us to find a way to resolve the outstanding problems
  that make most clustering methods impractical under certain circumstances. When
  the time series is very long, some clustering algorithms may fail because the very
  notation of similarity is dubious in high dimension space; many methods cannot handle
  missing data when the clustering is based on a distance ...
