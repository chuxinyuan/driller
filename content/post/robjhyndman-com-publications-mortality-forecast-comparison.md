  we compare the point and interval forecast accuracy and bias of ten principal component
  methods for forecasting mortality rates and life expectancy. The ten methods are
  variants and extensions of the Lee-Carter method. Based on one-step forecast errors,
  the weighted Hyndman-Ullah method provides the most accurate point forecasts of
  mortality rates and the Lee-Miller method is the least biased. For the accuracy
