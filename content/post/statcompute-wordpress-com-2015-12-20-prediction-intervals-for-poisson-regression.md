description: Different from the confidence interval that is to address the uncertainty
  related to the conditional mean, the prediction interval is to accommodate the additional
  uncertainty associated with prediction errors. As a result, the prediction interval
  is always wider than the confidence interval in a regression model. In the context
  of risk modeling, the prediction interval ...
