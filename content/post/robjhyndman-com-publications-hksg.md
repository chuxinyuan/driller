description: We provide a new approach to automatic busineswwwwws forecasting based
  on an extended range of exponential smoothing methods. Each method in our taxonomy
  of exponential smoothing methods can be shown to be equivalent to the forecasts
  obtained from a state space model. This allows (1) the easy calculation of the likelihood,
  the AIC and other model selection criteria; (2) the computation of prediction intervals
  for each method; and (3) random simulation from the underlying state space ...
