description: In this paper, we focus on expensive multiobjective optimization problems
  and propose a method to predict an approximation of the Pareto optimal set using
  classification of sampled decision vectors as dominated or nondominated. The performance
  of our method, called EPIC, is demonstrated on a set of benchmark problems used
  in the multiobjective optimization literature and compared with state-of-the-art
  methods, ParEGO and PAL. The initial results are promising and encourage further
