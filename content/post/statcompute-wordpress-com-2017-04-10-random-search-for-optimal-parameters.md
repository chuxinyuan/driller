description: Practices of manual search, grid search, or the combination of both have
  been successfully employed in the machine learning to optimize hyper-parameters.
  However, in the arena of deep learning, both approaches might become impractical.
  For instance, the computing cost of grid search for hyper-parameters in a multi-layer
  deep neural network (DNN) could be prohibitively high. ...
