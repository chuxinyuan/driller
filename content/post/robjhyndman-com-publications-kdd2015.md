description: A large body of the forecasting literature so far has been focused on
  forecasting the conditional mean of future observations. However, there is an increasing
  need for generating the entire conditional distribution of future observations in
  order to effectively quantify the uncertainty in time series data. We present two
  different methods for probabilistic time series forecasting that allow the inclusion
  of a possibly large set of exogenous variables. One method is based on forecasting
  both the conditional mean and variance of the future distribution using a traditional
