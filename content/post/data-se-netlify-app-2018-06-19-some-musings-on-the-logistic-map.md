  The logistic map is a well-known and simple growth model that is defined by the iterative equation
  \[x_{t+1} = 4rx_t(1-t_t)\],
  where \(r\) is a parameter that can be thought of as a fertility and reproduction rate of the population. The allowed values of \(x\) range between 0 an 1 inclusively, where 0 means the population is extinct. The maximum of 1 can be interpreted as the ecological carrying capacity of the ...
