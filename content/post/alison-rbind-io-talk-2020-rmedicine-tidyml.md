description: <p>This four-hour workshop will provide a gentle introduction to machine
  learning with R using the modern suite of predictive modeling packages called <a
  href="https://github.com/tidymodels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tidymodels</a>.
  We will build, evaluate, compare, and tune predictive models. Along the way, we’ll
  learn about key concepts in machine learning including overfitting, the holdout
  method, the bias-variance trade-off, ensembling, cross-validation, and feature engineering.
  Learners will gain knowledge about good predictive modeling practices, as well as
  hands-on experience ...
