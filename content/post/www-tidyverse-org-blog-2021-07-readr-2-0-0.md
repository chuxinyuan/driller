  <p>We&rsquo;re thrilled to announce the release of <a href="https://readr.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">readr</a> 2.0.0!</p>
  <p>The readr package makes it easy to get rectangular data out of comma separated (csv), tab separated (tsv) or fixed width files (fwf) and into R. It is designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes.</p>
  <p>The easiest way to install the latest version from CRAN is to install the whole tidyverse.</p>
