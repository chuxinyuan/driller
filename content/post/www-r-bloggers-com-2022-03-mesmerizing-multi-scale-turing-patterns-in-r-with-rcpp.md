  <p>Multi-scale Turing patterns<br />
  Turing patterns are a type of reaction-diffusion systems that have attracted much interest as a basic model for the formation of patterns in nature, such as stripes, spots and spirals. The behavior of such diffusion systems was studied by Alan Turing in his classical paper (Turing 1952) and ...</p>
