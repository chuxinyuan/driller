description: The half-life is defined as the number of periods required for the impulse
  response to a unit shock to a time series to dissipate by half. It is widely used
  as a measure of persistence, especially in international economics to quantify the
  degree of mean-reversion of the deviation from an international parity condition.
  Several studies have proposed bias-corrected point and interval estimation methods.
  However, they have found that the confidence intervals are rather uninformative
  with their upper bound being either extremely large or ...
