description: In the post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2018/11/23/more-robust-monotonic-binning-based-on-isotonic-regression),
  a more robust version of monotonic binning based on the isotonic regression was
  introduced. Nonetheless, due to the loss of granularity, the predictability has
  been somewhat compromised, which is a typical dilemma in the data science. On one
  hand, we don&#8217;t want to use a learning algorithm that is too greedy ...
