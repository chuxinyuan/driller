  naniar 1.0.0 I&rsquo;m very pleased to announce that naniar version 1.0.0 is now on CRAN!
  Version 1.0.0 of naniar is to signify that this release is associated with the publication of the associated JSS paper doi:10.18637/jss.v105.i07 (!!!). This paper has been the labour of a lot of effort between myself and Di Cook, and I am very excited to be able to share it.
  There is still a lot to do in naniar, and this release does not signify that there are no changes ...
