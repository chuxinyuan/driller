description: We propose a new method for estimation of the hazard function from a
  set of censored failure time data, with a view to extending the general approach
  to more complicated models. The approach is based on a mixed model representation
  of penalized spline hazard estimators. One payoff is the automation of the smoothing
  parameter choice through restricted maximum likelihood. Another is the option to
  use standard mixed model software for automatic hazard ...
