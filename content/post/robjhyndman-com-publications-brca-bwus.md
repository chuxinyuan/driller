description: The disparity in breast cancer mortality rates among white and black
  US women is widening, with higher mortality rates among black women. We apply functional
  time series models on age-specific breast cancer mortality rates for each group
  of women, and forecast their mortality curves using exponential smoothing state-space
  models with damping. The data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology
  and End Results (SEER) program of the US. Mortality data were obtained from the
