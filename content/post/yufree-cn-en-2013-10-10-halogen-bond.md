  the Halogen bond is the non-covalent interaction that occurs between a halogen atom
  (Lewis acid) and a Lewis base. The Hydrogen bond could be seen as a special case
  of halogen bond — they all need electron-donor while the hydrogen may also need
  electron-receptor. In fact, some Organic Halogen Compounds such as PCBs, PBDEs,PFCs,SCCPs&hellip;
  were hard to analysis for they have so many congeners. Most of time, the capillary
  columns were used to separate those compounds. However, when we use the capillary
  columns ...
