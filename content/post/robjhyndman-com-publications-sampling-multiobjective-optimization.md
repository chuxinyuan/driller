description: We investigate the impact of different sampling techniques on the performance
  of multi-objective optimization methods applied to costly black-box optimization
  problems. Such problems are often solved using an algorithm in which a surrogate
  model approximates the true objective function and provides predicted objective
  values at a lower cost. As the surrogate model is based on evaluations of a small
  number of points, the quality of the initial sample can have a great effect on the
  overall effectiveness of the ...
