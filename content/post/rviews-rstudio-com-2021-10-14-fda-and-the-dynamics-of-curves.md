  <p>An elegant application of Functional Data Analysis is to model longitudinal data
  as a curve and then study the curve’s dynamics. For example, in pharmacokinetics
  and other medical studies analyzing multiple measurements of drug or protein concentrations
  in blood samples, it may be interest to determine if the concentrations in subjects
  undergoing one type of treatment rise quicker than those undergoing an alternative
  treatment. In this post, I will generate some plausible fake data for ...'
