  approach'

description: The state space approach to modelling univariate time series is now widely
  used both in theory and in applications. However, the very richness of the framework
  means that quite different model formulations are possible, even when they purport
  to describe the same phenomena. In this paper, we examine the single source of error
  [SSOE] scheme, which has perfectly correlated error components. We then proceed
  to compare SSOE to the more common version of the state space models, for which
  all the error terms are independent; we refer to this as the multiple source of
  error [MSOE] ...
