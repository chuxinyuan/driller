description: We present a local linear estimator with variable bandwidth for multivariate
  nonparametric regression. We prove its consistency and asymptotic normality in the
  interior of the observed data and obtain its rates of convergence. This result is
  used to obtain practical direct plug-in bandwidth selectors for heteroscedastic
  regression in one and two dimensions. We show that the local linear estimator with
  variable bandwidth has better goodness-of-fit properties than the local linear estimator
  with constant bandwidth, in the presence of ...
