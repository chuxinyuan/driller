title: “Masks block some fraction of viral particles from dispersing from those who
  are infected and from infecting those who are susceptible . . . studies that did
  not find masks to be effective had limited statistical power and therefore do not
  imply that masks are ineffective . . . The studies that did not find statistically
  significant effects prove only that masks cannot offer protection if they are not
  worn.”
