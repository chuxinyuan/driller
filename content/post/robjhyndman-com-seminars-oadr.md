description: Presentation given to ARLES (Ageing Risks and their Long-term impact
  on the Economy and Society) I&rsquo;ll describe how to forecast the old-age dependency
  ratio for Australia under various pension age proposals, and estimate a pension
  age scheme that will provide a stable old-age dependency ratio at a specified level.
  The approach involves a stochastic population forecasting method based on coherent
  functional data models for mortality, fertility and net migration, which is used
  to simulate the future age-structure of the ...
