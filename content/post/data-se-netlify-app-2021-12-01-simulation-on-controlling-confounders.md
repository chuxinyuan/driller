  Confounder A confounder is on of the few (maybe three) “atoms” of causality, following the framework of Judea Parl and others.
  A confounder can be depicted like this:
  Following a study that reported a strong correlation between chocolate consumption and Nobel prices. Simulating a confounder structure Now let’s simulate a simple confounder structure.
  Here’s some code that will help us:
