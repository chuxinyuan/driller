description: In my previous post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2018/01/28/modeling-lgd-with-proportional-odds-model),
  I’ve discussed how to use Proportional Odds Models in the LGD model development.
  In particular, I specifically mentioned that we would estimate a sub-model, which
  can be Gamma or Simplex regression, to project the conditional mean for LGD values
  in the (0, 1) range. However, it is worth pointing out ...
