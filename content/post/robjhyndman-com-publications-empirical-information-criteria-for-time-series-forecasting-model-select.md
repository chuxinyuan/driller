description: In this paper, we propose a new Empirical Information Criterion (EIC)
  for model selection which penalizes the likelihood of the data by a function of
  the number of parameters in the model. It is designed to be used where there are
  a large number of time series to be forecast. However, a bootstrap version of the
  EIC can be used where there is a single time series to be forecast. The EIC provides
  a data-driven model selection tool that can be tuned to the particular forecasting
