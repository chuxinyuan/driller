   <p>So you have heard of <a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a>, a new tool based on Pandoc
  for technical publishing. When you first see a <code>.qmd</code> document (Quarto), it
  looks quite similar to an <code>.Rmd</code> document (R Markdown), which can easily confuse
  R Markdown users. Questions can arise naturally: Why inventing a new system? Why
  cannot you just add the new features to the existing R Markdown ecosystem? Is R
  Markdown going to be retired? I will share some thoughts in this post. For those
  who prefer reading a shorter official FAQ, please visit <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/faq ...
