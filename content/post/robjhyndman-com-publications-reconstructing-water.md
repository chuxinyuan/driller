description: In-situ sensors that collect high-frequency data are used increasingly
  to monitor aquatic environments. These sensors are prone to technical errors, resulting
  in unrecorded observations and/or anomalous values that are subsequently removed
  and create gaps in time series data. We present a framework based on generalized
  additive and auto-regressive models to recover these missing data. To mimic sporadically
  missing (i) single observations and (ii) periods of contiguous observations, we
  randomly removed (i) point data and (ii) day and week-long sequences of data from
  a two-year time series of ...
