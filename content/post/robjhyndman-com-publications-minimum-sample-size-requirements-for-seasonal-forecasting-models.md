description: How much data do you need to forecast using a seasonal model? The answer
  depends on the type of model being used and the amount of random variation in the
  data. We discuss the mathematical limits for estimating various common seasonal
  forecasting models from data. These limits apply when the amount of random variation
  is very small. Real data often contain a lot of random variation, and then many
  more observations are ...
