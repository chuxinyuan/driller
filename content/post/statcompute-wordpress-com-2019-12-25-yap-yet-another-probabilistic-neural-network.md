description: By the end of 2019, I finally managed to wrap up my third R package YAP
  (https://github.com/statcompute/yap) that implements the Probabilistic Neural Network
  (Specht, 1990) for the N-category pattern recognition with N &#62; 2. Similar to
  GRNN, PNN shares same benefits of instantaneous training, simple structure, and
  global convergence. Below is a demonstration showing how ...
