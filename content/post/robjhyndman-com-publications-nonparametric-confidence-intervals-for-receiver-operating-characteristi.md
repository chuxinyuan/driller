description: We study methods for constructing confidence intervals, and confidence
  bands, for estimators of receiver operating characteristics. Particular emphasis
  is placed on the way in which smoothing should be implemented, when estimating either
  the characteristic itself or its variance. We show that substantial undersmoothing
