  This is the notebook for chapter 5 in Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits.
  Epistasis Epistasis describes the nonadditivity of effects between loci.
  Consider an individual with alleles \(A_i\) and \(A_j\) at one locus and \(B_k\) and \(B_l\) at another.
  \[G_{ijkl}=\mu_G+(\alpha_i+\alpha_j+\delta_{ij})+(\alpha_k+\alpha_l+\delta_{kl})+\epsilon_{ijkl}\]
  With only two loci, there are actually three ways in which interactions can arise between loci: \(additive \times additive\)(\(\alpha\alpha\)), \(additive \times dominance\)(\(\alpha\delta\)), \(dominance \times dominance\)(\(\delta\delta\)). ...
