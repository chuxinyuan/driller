description: The decomposition of time series into components is an important task
  that helps to understand time series and can enable better forecasting. Nowadays,
  with high sampling rates leading to high-frequency data (such as daily, hourly,
  or minutely data), many datasets contain time series data that can exhibit multiple
  seasonal patterns. Although several methods have been proposed to decompose time
  series better under these circumstances, they are often computationally inefficient
