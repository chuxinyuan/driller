  Suppose you want a function to fit a neural network. What&rsquo;s the best way to find it? Here are three steps that help to find the elusive function relatively quickly.
  First, use help.search(&quot;neural&quot;) or the shorthand ??neural. This will search the help files of installed packages for the word &ldquo;neural&rdquo;. Actually, fuzzy matching is used so it returns pages that have words similar to &ldquo;neural&rdquo; such as &ldquo;natural&rdquo;. For a stricter search, use ...
