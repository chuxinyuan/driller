description: In the previous post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2016/11/27/more-about-flexible-frequency-models),
  I&#8217;ve shown how to estimate the double Poisson (DP) regression in R with the
  gamlss package. The hurdle of estimating DP regression is the calculation of a normalizing
  constant in the DP density function, which can be calculated either by the sum of
  an infinite series or by a closed ...
