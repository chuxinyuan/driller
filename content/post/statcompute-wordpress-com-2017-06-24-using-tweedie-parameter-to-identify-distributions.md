description: In the development of operational loss models, it is important to identify
  which distribution should be used to model operational risk measures, e.g. frequency
  and severity. For instance, why should we use the Gamma distribution instead of
  the Inverse Gaussian distribution to model the severity? In my previous post https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/modified-park-test-in-sas,
