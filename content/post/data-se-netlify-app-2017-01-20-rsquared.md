  It comes as no surprise that $$R^2$$ (&ldquo;coefficient of determination&rdquo;) equals $$r^2$$ in simple regression (predictor X, criterion Y), where $$r(X,Y)$$ is Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficient. $$R^2$$ equals the fraction of explained variance in a simple regression. However, the statistical (mathematical) background is often less clear or buried in less-intuitive formula.
  The goal of this post is to offer a gentle explanantion why
  $$R^2 = r^2$$,
  where $$r$$ is $$r(Y,\hat{Y})$$ and $$\hat{Y}$$ are the predicted ...
