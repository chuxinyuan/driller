description: In my early post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2017/01/22/monotonic-binning-with-smbinning-package/),
  I wrote a monobin() function based on the smbinning package by Herman Jopia to improve
  the monotonic binning algorithm. The function works well and provides robust binning
  outcomes. However, there are a couple potential drawbacks due to the coarse binning.
  First of all, the derived Information Value for each binned ...
