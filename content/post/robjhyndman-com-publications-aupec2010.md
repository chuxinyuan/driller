description: Short-term load forecasting is an essential instrument in power system
  planning, operation and control. Many operating decisions are based on load forecasts,
  such as dispatch scheduling of generating capacity, reliability analysis, and maintenance
  planning for the generators. Overestimation of electricity demand will cause a conservative
  operation, which leads to the start-up of too many units or excessive energy purchase,
  thereby supplying an unnecessary level of reserve. On the contrary, underestimation
  may result in a risky operation, with insufficient preparation of spinning reserve,
