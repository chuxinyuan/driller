description: Our paper, Generalized Oversampling for Learning from Imbalanced datasets
  and Associated Theory, writen with Denys Pommeret and Sam Stocksieker, is now available
  ArXiv. In supervised learning, it is quite frequent to be confronted with real imbalanced
  datasets. This situation leads to a learning difficulty for standard algorithms.
  Research and solutions in imbalanced learning have mainly focused on classification
  tasks. Despite its importance, very few solutions exist for imbalanced regression.
  In this paper, we propose a data augmentation procedure, the GOLIATH algorithm,
  based on kernel ...
