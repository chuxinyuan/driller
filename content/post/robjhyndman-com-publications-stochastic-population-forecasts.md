description: Age-sex-specific population forecasts are derived through stochastic
  population renewal using forecasts of mortality, fertility and net migration. Functional
  data models with time series coefficients are used to model age-specific mortality
  and fertility rates. As detailed migration data are lacking, net migration by age
  and sex is estimated as the difference between historic annual population data and
  successive populations one year ahead derived from a projection using fertility
  and mortality data. This estimate, which includes error, is also modeled using a
