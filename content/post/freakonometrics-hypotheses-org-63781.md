description: This post was intially written in French with Rodolphe Bigot (lecturer
  at the University of Picardie Jules Verne) in the Fall 2019. In 150 years, the concept
  of responsibility has evolved a lot, without ever disappearing. And today, we find
  it in a variety of contexts, from ecological or industrial disasters &#8211; we
  will evoke a &#8220;precautionary principle&#8221; that has blurred the very notion
  of causality &#8211; to &#8220;intelligent machines&#8221; &#8211; which leave the
  role of helper to finally make decisions in our place. &#8230; <a href="https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/6
