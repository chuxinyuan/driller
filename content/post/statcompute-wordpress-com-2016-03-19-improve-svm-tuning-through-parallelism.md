description: As pointed out in the chapter 10 of “The Elements of Statistical Learning”,
  ANN and SVM (support vector machines) share similar pros and cons, e.g. lack of
  interpretability and good predictive power. However, in contrast to ANN usually
  suffering from local minima solutions, SVM is always able to converge globally.
  In addition, SVM is less ...
