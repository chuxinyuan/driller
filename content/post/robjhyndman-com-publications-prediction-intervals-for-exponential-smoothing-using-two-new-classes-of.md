description: Three general classes of state space models are presented, based upon
  the single source of error formulation. The first class is the standard linear state
  space model with homoscedastic errors, the second retains the linear structure but
  incorporates a dynamic form of heteroscedasticity, and the third allows for non-linear
  structure in the observation equation as well as heteroscedasticity. These three
  classes provide stochastic models for a wide variety of exponential smoothing ...
