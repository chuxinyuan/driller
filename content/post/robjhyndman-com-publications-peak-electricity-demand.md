  role in planning for future generation facilities and transmission augmentation.
  In a long term context, planners must adopt a probabilistic view of potential peak
  demand levels, therefore density forecasts (providing estimates of the full probability
  distributions of the possible future values of the demand) are more helpful than
  point forecasts, and are necessary for utilities to evaluate and hedge the financial
  risk accrued by demand variability and forecasting ...'
