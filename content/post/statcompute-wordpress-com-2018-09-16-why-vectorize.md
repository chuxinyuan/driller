description: In the post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2018/09/15/how-to-avoid-for-loop-in-r),
  I briefly introduced the idea of vectorization and potential use cases. One might
  be wondering why we even need the Vectorize() function given the fact that it is
  just a wrapper and whether there is any material efficiency gain by vectorizing
  a function. It is true that the Vectorize() function is ...
