description: A crucial task in time series forecasting is the identification of the
  most suitable forecasting method. We present a general framework for forecast-model
  selection using meta-learning. A random forest is used to identify the best forecasting
  method using only time series features. The framework is evaluated using time series
  from the M1 and M3 competitions and is shown to yield accurate forecasts comparable
  to several benchmarks and other commonly used automated approaches of time series
