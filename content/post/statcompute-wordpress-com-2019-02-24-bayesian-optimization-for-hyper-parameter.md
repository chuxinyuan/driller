  literature about automatic parameter tuning in the context of Machine Learning (ML),
  most of which can be classified into two major categories, e.g. search and optimization.
  Searching mechanisms, such as grid search, random search, and Sobol sequence, can
  be somewhat computationally expensive. ...
