description: |-
  This is an example of how to use the demography package in R for stochastic population forecasting with coherent components. It is based on the papers by Hyndman and Booth (IJF 2008) and Hyndman, Booth and Yasmeen (Demography 2013). I will use Australian data from 1950 to 2009 and forecast the next 50 years.
  In demography, &ldquo;coherent&rdquo; forecasts are where male and females (or other sub-groups) do not diverge over ...
