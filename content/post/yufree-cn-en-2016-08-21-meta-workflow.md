  <p>I have moved to Canada for about three weeks. Now I am a PostDoc in University of Waterloo. I will handle two projects about <strong>in silico</strong> studies in analytical chemistry. Well, I treated them as another data and modeling-driven interdisciplinary studies.</p>
  <p>The first step is building the data analysis envrionment for group members. Since I could set down such envrionment on a super computer with RAM 128 GB, I preferred to use R and xcms for metabolomics data analysis.</p>
