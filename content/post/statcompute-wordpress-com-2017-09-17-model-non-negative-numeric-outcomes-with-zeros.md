description: As mentioned in the previous post (https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2017/06/29/model-operational-loss-directly-with-tweedie-glm/),
  we often need to model non-negative numeric outcomes with zeros in the operational
  loss model development. Tweedie GLM provides a convenient interface to model non-negative
  losses directly by assuming that aggregated losses are the Poisson sum of Gamma
  outcomes, which however might not be well supported empirically from ...
