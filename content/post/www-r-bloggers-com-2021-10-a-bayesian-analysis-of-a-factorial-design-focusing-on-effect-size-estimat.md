  <p>Factorial study designs present a number of analytic challenges, not least of which is how to best understand whether simultaneously applying multiple interventions is beneficial. Last time I presented a possible approach that focuses on estimating the variance of effect size estimates using a Bayesian model. The scenario I used ...</p></div>
