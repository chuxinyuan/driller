description: In my GitHub repository (https://github.com/statcompute/MonotonicBinning),
  multiple R functions have been developed to implement the monotonic binning by using
  either iterative discretization or isotonic regression. With these functions, we
  can run the monotonic binning for one independent variable at a time. However, in
  a real-world production environment, we often would want to apply the binning algorithm
