description: Outliers due to technical errors in water‐quality data from in situ sensors
  can reduce data quality and have a direct impact on inference drawn from subsequent
  data analysis. However, outlier detection through manual monitoring is infeasible
  given the volume and velocity of data the sensors produce. Here we introduce an
  automated procedure, named oddwater, that provides early detection of outliers in
