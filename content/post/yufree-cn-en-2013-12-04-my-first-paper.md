  <p>This is the first paper written by me which was just published on <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em>, pp 13494–13501, Volume 47, Issue 23, 2013. You could access the full text either by <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es404144p">ACS&rsquo;s website</a> or just send <a href="mailto:liujy@rcees.ac.cn">Dr. Liu</a> or <a href="mailto:yufreecas@gmail.com">me</a> an email.</p>
  <p>This work focused on the metabolites of BDE-28 in plant. The main finding is that after the exposure, BDE-28 could be transformed to OH-diBDEs, OH-triBDEs and MeO-triBDEs. Without the standards ...
