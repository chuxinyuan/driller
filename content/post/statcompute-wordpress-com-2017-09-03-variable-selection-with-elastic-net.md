description: LASSO has been a popular algorithm for the variable selection and extremely
  effective with high-dimension data. However, it often tends to “over-regularize”
  a model that might be overly compact and therefore under-predictive. The Elastic
  Net addresses the aforementioned “over-regularization” by balancing between LASSO
  and ridge penalties. In particular, a hyper-parameter, namely Alpha, would be used
