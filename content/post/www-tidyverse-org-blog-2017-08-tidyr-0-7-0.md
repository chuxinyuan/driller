   <p>We are happy to announce that tidyr 0.7.0 is now available on CRAN. There are two big changes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>tidyr now supports tidy evaluation (or tidy eval for short). You can find an introduction to tidy eval in the <a href="http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html">programming with dplyr</a> vignette.</p></li>
  <li><p>tidyr uses the new tidyselect package as selection backend.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This will probably only affect your code in minor ways but helps improve consistency across the tidyverse. You can read about the complete set of changes at <a href="https://github.com/tid ...
