title: A new GEE method to account for heteroscedasticity using asymmetric least-square
  regressions

description: Our paper, with Amadou Barry and Karim Oualkacha, a new GEE method to
  account for heteroscedasticity using asymmetric least-square regressions is now
  published in the Journal of Applied Statistics Generalized estimating equations
  (GEE) are widely used to analyze longitudinal data; however, they are not appropriate
  for heteroscedastic data, because they only estimate regressor effects on the mean
  response – and therefore do not account for data heterogeneity. Here, we combine
  the GEE with the asymmetric least squares (expectile) regression to derive a new
  class &#8230; <a href="https://freakono ...
