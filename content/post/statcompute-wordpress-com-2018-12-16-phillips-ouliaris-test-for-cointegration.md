description: In a project of developing PPNR balance projection models, I tried to
  use the Phillips-Ouliaris (PO) test to investigate the cointegration between the
  historical balance and a set of macro-economic variables and noticed that implementation
  routines of PO test in various R packages, e.g. urca and tseries, would give different
  results. After reading through the ...
