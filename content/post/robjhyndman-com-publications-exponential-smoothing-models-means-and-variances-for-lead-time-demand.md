description: Exponential smoothing is often used to forecast lead-time demand for
  inventory control. In this paper, formulae are provided for calculating means and
  variances of lead-time demand for a wide variety of exponential smoothing methods.
  A feature of many of the formulae is that variances, as well as the means, depend
  on trends and seasonal effects. Thus, these formulae provide the opportunity to
  implement methods that ensure that safety stocks adjust to changes in trend or changes
