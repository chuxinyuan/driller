description: Smart electricity meters are currently deployed in millions of households
  to collect detailed individual electricity consumption data. Compared to traditional
  electricity data based on aggregated consumption, smart meter data are much more
  volatile and less predictable. There is a need within the energy industry for probabilistic
  forecasts of household electricity consumption to quantify the uncertainty of future
  electricity demand, in order to undertake appropriate planning of generation and
  distribution. We propose a probabilistic forecasting method where a different quantile
