description: In the post https://statcompute.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/assess-variable-importance-in-grnn,
  it was shown how to assess the variable importance of a GRNN by the decrease in
  GoF statistics, e.g. AUC, after averaging or dropping the variable of interest.
  The permutation feature importance evaluates the variable importance in a similar
  manner by permuting values of the variable, which attempts to break the ...
