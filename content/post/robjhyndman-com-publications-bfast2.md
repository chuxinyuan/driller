description: A challenge in phenology studies is understanding what constitutes significant
  phenological change amidst background variation (e.g. noise) and ecosystem disturbances
  (e.g. fires). The majority of phenological studies have focussed on extracting critical
  points in the seasonal growth cycle (e.g. Start-of-spring), without exploiting the
  full temporal detail. Moreover, the high degree of phenological variability between
  years demonstrates the necessity of distinguishing long term phenological change
  from temporal variability. Here, we evaluate the phenological change detection ability
  of a ...
