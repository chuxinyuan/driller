description: In several previous posts, I&#8217;ve shown how to estimate severity
  models under the various distributional assumptions, including Lognormal, Gamma,
  and Inverse Gaussian. However, I am not satisfied with the fact that the supporting
  domain of aforementioned distributions doesn&#8217;t include the value at ZERO.
  Today, I had spent some time on looking into another interesting distribution, ...
