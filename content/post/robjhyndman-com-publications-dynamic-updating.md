description: Abstract We present a nonparametric method to forecast a seasonal univariate
  time series, and propose four dynamic updating methods to improve point forecast
  accuracy. Our methods consider a seasonal univariate time series as a functional
  time series. We propose first to reduce the dimensionality by applying functional
  principal component analysis to the historical observations, and then to use univariate
  time series forecasting and functional principal component regression techniques.
  When data in the most recent year are partially observed, we improve point forecast
  accuracy using dynamic ...
