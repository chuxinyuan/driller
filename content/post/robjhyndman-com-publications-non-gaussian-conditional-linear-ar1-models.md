description: We give a general formulation of a non-Gaussian conditional linear AR(1)
  model subsuming most of the non-Gaussian AR(1) models that have appeared in the
  literature. We derive some general results giving properties for the stationary
  process mean, variance and correlation structure, and conditions for stationarity.
  These results highlight similarities and differences with the Gaussian AR(1) model,
  and unify many separate results appearing in the literature. Examples illustrate
  the wide range of properties that can appear under the conditional linear autoregressive
