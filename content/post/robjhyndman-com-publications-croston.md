description: Intermittent demand commonly occurs with inventory data, with many time
  periods having no demand and small demand in the other periods. Croston&rsquo;s
  method is a widely used procedure for intermittent demand forecasting. However,
  it is an ad~hoc method with no properly formulated underlying stochastic model.
  In this paper, we explore possible models underlying Croston&rsquo;s method and
  three related methods, and we show that any underlying model will be inconsistent
  with the properties of intermittent demand ...
