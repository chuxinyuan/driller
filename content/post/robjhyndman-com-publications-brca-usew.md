  Background: Mortality/incidence predictions are used for planning public health resources and need to accurately reflect age-related changes through time. We present a new forecasting model to estimate future trends in age-related breast cancer mortality for the United States and England-Wales.
  Material and methods: We use functional data analysis techniques to model breast cancer mortality-age relationships in the United States from 1950 to 2001 and England-Wales from 1950 to 2003, and estimate 20-year predictions using a new forecasting ...
