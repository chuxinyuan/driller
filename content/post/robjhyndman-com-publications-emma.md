description: In industry as well as many areas of scientific research, data collected
  often contain a number of responses of interest for a chosen set of exploratory
  variables. Optimization of such multivariable multiresponse systems is a challenge
  well suited to genetic algorithms as global optimization tools. One such example
  is the optimization of coating surfaces with the required absolute and relative
  sensitivity for detecting analytes using devices such as sensor arrays. High-throughput
  synthesis and screening methods can be used to accelerate materials discovery and
  optimization; however, an ...
