description: Automatic forecasts of large numbers of univariate time series are often
  needed in business and other contexts. We describe two automatic forecasting algorithms
  that have been implemented in the forecast package for R. The first is based on
  innovation state space models that underly exponential smoothing methods. The second
  is based on ARIMA models. The algorithms are applicable to both seasonal and non-seasonal
  data, and are compared and illustrated using four real time ...
