description: We show that the least squares approach to reconciling hierarchical time
  series forecasts can be extended to much more general collections of time series
  with aggregation constraints. The constraints arise due to the need for forecasts
  of collections of time series to add up in the same way as the observed time series.
  We also show that the computations involved can be handled efficiently by exploiting
  the structure of the associated design matrix, or by using sparse matrix ...
