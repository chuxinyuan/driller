title: Statistical issues with using herbarium data for the estimation of invasion

description: Current methods for using herbarium data as time series, for example
  to estimate the length of the invasion lag phase, often make assumptions that are
  both statistically and logically inappropriate. We present an alternative statistical
  approach, estimating the lag phase based on annual rather than cumulative data,
  a generalized linear model incorporating a log link for overall collection effort,
  and piecewise linear splines. We demonstrate the method on two species representing
  good and poor data quality, then apply it to two data sets comprising 448 species/region
