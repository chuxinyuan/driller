description: We suggest two new methods for conditional density estimation. The first
  is based on locally fitting a log-linear model, and is in the spirit of recent work
  on locally parametric techniques in density estimation. The second method is a constrained
  local polynomial estimator. Both methods always produce non-negative estimators.
  We propose an algorithm suitable for selecting the two bandwidths for either estimator.
  We also develop a new bootstrap test for the symmetry of conditional density ...
