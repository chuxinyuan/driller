  post entitled Rethinking responsibility and causality. Historically, algorithms
  were content to provide decision support, leaving a human being to make the decision,
  but experiments are underway, with autonomous systems, making decisions, whether
  it be car driving systems, or predictive justice algorithms, as shown by Huss et
  al. (2018). This autonomy, which basically means the &#8220;ability to act freely&#8221;
