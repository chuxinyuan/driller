description: Many applications require forecasts for a hierarchy comprising a set
  of time series along with aggregates of subsets of these series. Although forecasts
  can be produced independently for each series in the hierarchy, typically this does
  not lead to coherent forecasts — the property that forecasts add up appropriately
  across the hierarchy. State-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods usually
  reconcile these independently generated forecasts to satisfy the aggregation constraints.
  A fundamental limitation of prior research is that it has looked only at the problem
  of forecasting the mean ...
