description: In forecast value added analysis, the accuracy of relatively sophisticated
  forecasting methods is compared to that of naïve 1 forecasts to see whether the
  extra costs and effort of implementing them are justified. In this note, we derive
  a ratio that indicates the upper bound of a forecasting method’s accuracy relative
  to naïve 1 forecasts when the mean squared error is used to measure one-period-ahead
  accuracy. The ratio is applicable when a series is stationary or when its first
  differences are ...
