  A typical and quite straight forward operation in R and the tidyverse is to apply a function on each column of a data frame (or on each element of a list, which is the same for that regard).
  However, the orthogonal question of “how to apply a function on each row” is much less labored. We will look at this question in this post, and explore some (of many) answers to this ...
