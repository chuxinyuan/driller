  There are a lot of explanations of Monte Carlo approximation out there.
  Here is one that worked for me.
  A famous mathematician named Stan Ulam liked solitaire.
  He wanted to work out the probability of getting a perfect solitaire hand.
  Being a mathematician, he also wanted to work this out analytically.
  What does analytical mean? It&rsquo;s a fair question, as it&rsquo;s wikipedia page shows that there are many definitions
