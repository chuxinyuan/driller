description: The switching regression is an extension of the Heckit model, which is
  also known as the type-V Tobit model and assumes that there is a multivariate normal
  distribution for three latent variables Y1*, Y2*, and Y3* such that A. Y1 = 1 for
  Y1* &#62; 0 and Y1 = 0 for Y1* &#60;= 0; B. ...
